## a group of simple mobile robots joined together

`code-1`

a simple pseudocode that represents a simple algorithm that emulates the learning and optimization process of a group of simple mobile robots joined together. 

1. Initialize Parameters and Variables:
   - It defines some parameters, such as the maximum speed of the robots (`max_speed`) and the duration of the inflation and deflation cycle (`inflation_cycle_duration`).

2. Initialize a Chain of Mobile Robots:
   - The algorithm initializes a chain of mobile robots, each of which has its characteristics, including a start time for the inflation cycle and variables to store learned information.

3. Learning Process for Each Robot:
   - For each robot in the chain, the algorithm goes through a learning process to optimize their movement.
   - It randomly selects a start time within the inflation cycle.
   - It repeatedly inflates the tubing, measures how far the robot moves, and updates the maximum velocity and the start time for the inflation cycle based on the measurements.
   - This process continues until convergence or a specific number of cycles.

4. Coordination and Forward Motion:
   - After learning, the algorithm checks if each robot's learned maximum velocity is within acceptable bounds.
   - If a robot's maximum velocity is too high, it is capped at the maximum speed (`max_speed`).
   - If a robot's maximum velocity is too low (less than one-quarter of the maximum speed), it is adjusted to be at one-quarter of the maximum speed.

5. Addressing Friction Issues:
   - The algorithm checks for issues related to friction by comparing a robot's current location to a problematic location.
   - If a robot encounters friction issues at a specific location, it attempts to power through it by setting its maximum velocity to the maximum speed.
   - It then re-optimizes the start time for the inflation cycle to maintain the optimal speed afterward.

6. Testing Recovery from Failure:
   - The algorithm tests the system's ability to recover from failure by simulating a blocked valve in one of the robots.
   - Even if the valve is blocked, it continues to cycle the pump to reduce friction.
   - It may also turn the pump on and off to produce vibrations that help reduce friction, even when the pump is not pushing any air.

7. Handling Refinement for Longer Chains:
   - If the chain of robots becomes longer (more than three robots), the algorithm may need to adjust its refinement strategy for synchronization.
   - For very long chains (more than seven robots), it handles synchronization differently.

8. Printing a Conclusion:
   - The pseudocode concludes by printing a message indicating that the self-learning system is effective, scalable, and robust to damage.

This pseudocode is a simplified representation and does not include specific details of the learning algorithms or the exact coordination strategies used in the research described in the original text. It serves as a high-level overview of the process and concepts involved in the system's learning and optimization.

## adapt code-1 to a humanoid robot made of tetrahedrons 

`code-2`

This modified pseudocode uses tetrahedral units as the building blocks for the humanoid robot and adapts the learning, coordination, and friction-handling processes accordingly. 
Please note that the specific mechanics of how tetrahedral units move and interact need further development and consideration in a real-world implementation.

## forth code 
`forth-1`

This Forth code attempts to mirror the structure and functionality of the pseudocode code-2, but specific implementations (like initializing the tetrahedral chain, measuring distance moved, handling friction, and others) still need to be filled in based on the specific hardware and capabilities of your robot. Forth's syntax and programming paradigms differ significantly from more common procedural languages, so this code is structured to align with Forth's stack-based operation.
